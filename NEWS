ModemManager 1.18.8
-------------------------------------------

 * A new connection status dispatcher setup is provided, where users can
   provide custom scripts that will be called on bearer connect/disconnect
   events. This dispatcher will make the netifd integration in openwrt work
   much better, as we'll be able to report network-initiated disconnections
   cleanly to netifd.

   There are no default connection status dispatcher scripts installed, but
   it's suggested distributions make sure the following directories exist:
     - ${sysconfdir}/ModemManager/connection.d/
     - ${libdir}/ModemManager/connection.d/

 * Several other improvements and fixes.


ModemManager 1.18.4
-------------------------------------------

 * A new FCC unlock operation management via external scripts is introduced,
   which will avoid to automatically unlock FCC locked devices unless the user
   has configured the operation manually, or unless an official vendor-provided
   FCC unlock tool is found in the system.

   Please refer to the following URL for full details:
   https://modemmanager.org/docs/modemmanager/fcc-unlock/

   The following changes should be taken into account by distribution packagers:
   ** A set of FCC unlock scripts named as the specific vendor 'vid' will be
      installed in ${datadir}/ModemManager/fcc-unlock.available.d.
   ** A set of symlinks is created named as the specific device 'vid:pid', and
      pointing to the per-vendor 'vid' files, in the same location inside
      ${datadir}.
   ** A new ${sysconfdir}/ModemManager/fcc-unlock.d directory is created, where
      users will manually install additional symlinks to the scripts shipped in
      ${datadir}.
   ** A new ${libdir}/ModemManager/fcc-unlock.d directory is created, where
      vendors will install their own official FCC unlock tools.
   ** Both fcc-unlock.d directories should be empty on a new install, and their
      contents (if any) should not be removed on ModemManager upgrades.

 * build,meson:
   ** All optional settings in the build (e.g. introspection, systemd
      suspend/resume support, udev...) are now booleans (true/false) instead
      of features. Having dependencies as 'auto' has given problems since the
      very beginning when using autotools, because sometimes the build goes on
      even if all the features required by the user were not enabled. This
      change in the meson build now requires the user to explicitly enable or
      disable features. This is for consistency across all libqrtr-glib, libqmi,
      libmbim and ModemManager.
   ** If the build relies on enabling specific plugins, though, these are still
      features (enable/disable/auto). The user may disable all plugins with
      `-Dauto_features=disabled` and then enable specific plugins independently.
   ** Fixed the plugin dependency on build options.

 * libmm-glib:
   ** The license text in several source files of the library is fixed to reflect
      that they are LGPLv2+, as the whole library. This is not a relicense of any
      kind, just a fix in the wording.

 * modem interface:
   ** Always set error if creating device identifier fails.

 * firmware interface:
   ** Fix missing context initialization leading to crash.

 * profile manager interface:
   ** Fix incorrect GError ownership management.

 * mbim:
   ** Fix crash when processing DNS addresses on a connection attempt.
   ** Fix incorrect GError ownership management when reloading connection status.

 * qmi:
   ** Fix non-initialized GError.

 * sms:
   ** Merge WDP multipart CDMA WAP messages.
   ** Increase default send timeout from 180s to 300s.

 * kerneldevice:
   ** Fix pattern matching logic in the custom udev rules parser, required to
      correctly handle devices in the WWAN subsystem in kernel 5.13.

 * plugins:
   ** qcom-soc: this plugin is now enabled by default, so that it can be used on
      several new laptops based on Qualcomm SoCs.
   ** qcom-soc: updated to require the explicit ID_MM_QCOM_SOC udev tag.
   ** telit: fix critical message when attempting to unref a NULL object.
   ** telit: allow unlock retries loading for unknown error csim reply.
   ** telit: avoid sim hot swap procedure if #QSS is not supported.
   ** telit: add port type hints for LE910S1 0x7010, 0x7011 compositions.
   ** quectel: fix non-initialized GError.
   ** foxconn: added support for T99W265 modules.

 * Several other improvements and fixes.


ModemManager 1.18.2
-------------------------------------------

 * build,meson:
   ** The minimum required meson version is now 0.53.0.
   ** Fixed generation of shared utils and plugin modules, so that they don't
      include and export symbols that are internal of the daemon.
   ** Fixed the definition of the plugins directory path so that it's an
      absolute one instead of one relative to the prefix.
   ** Fixed the usage of the systemd suspend/resume build option.
   ** Optional features like introspection support, QMI support, MBIM support,
      QRTR support... are all now defined as meson 'features' (i.e. 'auto',
      'enabled' or 'disabled') instead of booleans (i.e. 'false' or 'true').
   ** Several other improvements and fixes.

 * plugins:
   ** novatel: fix crash when returning a NULL timezone without any error set.

ModemManager 1.18.0
-------------------------------------------
This is a new stable release of ModemManager.

The following notes are directed to package maintainers:

 * This version now requires:
   ** glib2 >= 2.56
   ** libgudev >= 232
   ** libmbim >= 1.26.0 (for the optional MBIM support)
   ** libqmi >= 1.30.2 (for the optional QMI support)
   ** libqrtr-glib >= 1.0.0 (for the optional QRTR support)

 * The ModemManager.service file for systemd integration provided in the sources
   is updated as follows:
   ** 'CAP_NET_ADMIN' is now required in the 'CapabilityBoundingSet' field.
   ** 'AF_NETLINK' and 'AF_QIPCRTR' are now required in the
      'RestrictAddressFamilies' field.
   If the system where ModemManager is being integrated provides a custom
   systemd service configuration, these updates should be considered.

 * The LEGACY and PARANOID filter types that were allowed options in the
   '--filter-policy' option in the ModemManager daemon were deprecated in
   version 1.16.0 and have now been completely removed, along with the vid:pid
   blacklist of devices and the vid:pid greylist of RS232<->USB adapters.

 * Building from git no longer requires autoconf-archive, the needed AX_ macros
   are now shipped inside m4/.

 * In addition to building from a source release tarball, or building from git
   checkouts using the GNU autotools suite (autoconf/automake/libtool), this
   release includes the initial support for the meson build system. The meson
   port is not fully complete yet, as there are some missing things in the doc
   generation and test steps, but for system integration or development
   purposes, the port should be fully operational. This major release, including
   all its stable updates in the 1.18.x series, will be the last ones providing
   support for GNU autotools. The next major release will likely be a meson-only
   one, and will therefore not be based on a source release tarball any more,
   but on specific git tags instead.

The most important features and changes in this release are the following:

 * Data session multiplexing can now be enabled in QMI and MBIM modems, e.g. so
   that multiple different APNs can be connected separately over a single
   network interface. The multiplexing is disabled by default in this release,
   except for cases where it's required (e.g. if non-multiplexed sessions aren't
   supported) like IPA based Qualcomm SoCs. Users can request the multiplexing
   support explicitly via settings when creating the connection bearer object.

   In order to allow easy testing of the multiplexing feature without requiring
   any additional change in the stack, a new '--test-multiplex-requested' option
   in the daemon allows to switch the default (when not explicitly given by the
   user) to attempt to use multiplexing.

   It is worth noting that when multiplexing is enabled, the data network
   interface used by the modem will be a virtual network interface created in
   runtime, and will therefore have a different name than the real network
   interface exposed by the modem. If there are additional settings in the
   system relying on the data network interface name (e.g. iptables rules), they
   may need to be updated.

 * The ModemManager daemon can run now in a 'quick suspend/resume' mode, in
   which no explicit data disconnection is triggered on suspend, and no explicit
   device re-probing from scratch is launched on resume. Instead, the daemon
   will try to refresh the state of all interfaces upon suspend, e.g. to see if
   the module keeps registered to the same operator, to see if it is still
   connected, and so on.

   This mode of operation is useful when the WWAN module stays awake while the
   host is suspended, and can be enabled with the '--test-quick-suspend-resume'
   option in the daemon.

 * API:
   ** New '3gppProfileManager' interface, providing operations on the list of
      connection profiles stored in the 3GPP module. This interface is
      implemented for all AT, QMI and MBIM protocols.
   ** New 'DisableFacilityLock()' method in the 3GPP interface, implemented for
      QMI and MBIM devices.
   ** The 'MaxBearers' property is now deprecated, as it didn't provide any
      additional information to what 'MaxActiveBearers' already provides.
   ** New 'MaxActiveMultiplexedBearers' property, listing how many bearers can
      be connected at the same time if multiplexing is enabled.
   ** New settings in the bearer properties, applicable to both the
      'Simple.Connect()' and 'Modem.CreateBearer()' methods:
      *** 'multiplex': which allows the user to specify whether multiplexing
          should be avoided ('none'), whether it should be mandatory
	  ('required') or whether it should be enabled if available or skipped
	  if unavailable ('requested').
      *** 'profile-id': which allows the user to request a connection attempt
          with an existing profile stored in the module.
      *** 'apn-type': which allows the user to specify the purpose of a given
          connection, e.g. the user could create a connection to an APN
	  providing default internet connectivity and another one to an APN
	  providing access to the MMS gateway. This setting may or may not be
	  stored in the module itself, it depends on the type of module.
   ** New 'Multiplexed' boolean property in the Bearer object, specifying
      whether the bearer is connected through a multiplexed interface.
   ** New 'ConnectionError' property in the bearer object, specifying the last
      error reported by the module during a failed connection attempt or during
      a network-initiated disconnection.
   ** Updated the list of enum values in the MMMobileEquipmentError' type,
      according to the error codes defined in v17.1.0 of 3GPP TS 27.007.

 * Core:
   ** iconv() features support is detected at runtime, and logged when the
      daemon starts.
   ** Updated the base modem object to allow plugins to specify the types of
      data ports they support, based on the specific plugin implementations,
      e.g. so that a modem supporting only AT+PPP can ignore NET ports and
      vice versa.
   ** Added support for modems exposing control ports via QRTR channels.

 * Modem interface:
   ** The Dual SIM logic that would iterate over all slots during initialization
      is updated, so that we only report the information that we can gather
      without any explicit slot change. E.g. with QMI we can know whether there
      is a SIM in the non-active slot, and the ICCID of that SIM, but we cannot
      know the MCCMNC or the operator name of the SIM unless we change to that
      slot. We must not do slot changes arbitrarily like that, and so that logic
      is removed, even if we lose some of the information that we were providing
      in the interface.

 * Location interface:
   ** The multi-sentence NMEA trace support is updated to include additional
      possible trace types in addition to GSV (e.g. ALM, GSV, RTE, SFI) and also
      when coming from other constellations, not just GPS.

 * SIM:
   ** New 'PreferredNetworks' property and 'SetPreferredNetworks' method,
      implemented using '+CPOL' for generic AT modems and 'NAS Get/Set Preferred
      Networks' for QMI modems. Several different modules and plugins (e.g.
      Sierra Wireless EM7345, Telit LN930, SIM7070, all Option and Iridium
      devices...) have this feature explicitly disabled due to '+CPOL' not
      behaving properly (even crashing the module sometimes).

 * QMI:
   ** The logic that decides which data mode (802.3 or raw-ip) is used in
      modules managed by the qmi_wwan driver changes in this release. Until now,
      if a module reported itself as configured in 802.3 mode on boot, that mode
      would be the one used in normal operation. Due to the new multiplexing
      feature, this is no longer true, and if possible the daemon will always
      try to switch the module to raw-ip, and fallback to 802.3 only if raw-ip
      is unsupported.
   ** Enabled both AT and QMI indications for the messaging and voice interfaces
      so that new SMS and call events are reported via both channels. This
      solves issues seen in the Pinephone when waking up from suspend.
   ** Enabled network reject indications.
   ** If operator name not updated through standard indications, it will be
      explicitly queried with 'NAS Get Plmn Name'.
   ** Added support for transfer-route MT messages.
   ** Increased the QMI open timeout to 45s, as required by the newest modules.
   ** Implemented additional logic to read the status of the different facility
      locks in the module.
   ** Updated ICCID reading logic to parse it as hex instead of BCD.
   ** Improved handling of the MNC PCS digit in the operations involving MCCMNC.
   ** Automatically run the 'DPM Open Port' logic on IPA based setups to bind
      the hardware tx/rx endpoints with the logical ones in the QMI protocol.
   ** Implemented support for the Voice interface and its operations, not only
      standard voice call management, but also support for the supplementary
      services. Voice call management will be done completely using QMI, even
      if the new call indications are notified via AT URCs.

 * MBIM:
   ** Implemented support for Dual SIM in non-QMI MBIM devices, using the
      Microsoft Basic Connect Extensions service.
   ** Increased the timeout for the MBIM_CID_HOME_PROVIDER query to 30s.
   ** Updated to load model string using QMI over MBIM if available.
   ** Increased the MBIM open timeout to 45s, as required by the newest modules.

 * SMS:
   ** Defined a common timeout of 180s for all send operations.

 * libmm-glib:
   ** Updated with new methods and types to handle all the DBus API updates.
   ** Extended with additional methods in the Location3gpp object to get/set the
      full operator MCCMNC string, instead of integers without MNC PCS digit
      info.
   ** Extended the 'ModemLocation' interface with methods to get the signaled
      location updates; i.e. without requiring an explicit GetLocation(), and
      obviously only supported when location signaling is explicitly enabled.
   ** Updated the way the internal monitored properties are handled in the
      different types, now using some handy helper macros to share the same
      logic among all.

 * Plugins:
   ** zte: disabled CIND/CMER support.
   ** qcom-soc: added support for QRTR+IPA based setups.
   ** qcom-soc: added support for the WWAN subsystem instead of RPMSG.
   ** quectel: enabled QGPSXTRA by default when starting the GNSS engine.
   ** quectel: add support for EM120/160 PCIe modules.
   ** quectel: added Firehose update method.
   ** ublox: added additional URAT combinations.
   ** ublox: flagged UBANDSEL as unsupported in the SARA-R4 and -N4 modules.
   ** cinterion: added new custom MBIM based modem with shared reset operation.
   ** cinterion: ignored the MBIM Intel Firmware Update service completely.
   ** foxconn: added custom carrier config setup for the T77W968 module.

The following features which were backported to 1.16.x releases are also present
in ModemManager 1.18.0:

 * core: added support for the new 'WWAN' subsystem in Linux kernel 5.13,
   enabling PCIe-only modules.
 * core: The charset conversion methods rework, including the avoiding of the
   iconv() //TRANSLIT extension support, which isn't available in all libc
   implementations.
 * qmi: the logic managing allowed/preferred modes was fixed for multimode
   devices like the MC7304, making sure the acquisition order preference always
   had the same items.
 * serial: when modem is connected with AT+PPP, ignore forced disconnections, so
   that we don't take ownership of the PPP port before pppd has released it.
 * foxconn: added support for the T99W175 (SDX55) module, including built-in FCC
   unlock procedure.
 * foxconn: added new MBIM QDU firmware update method.


ModemManager 1.16.0
-------------------------------------------
This is a new stable release of ModemManager.

The following notes are directed to package maintainers:

 * This version now requires:
   ** libqmi >= 1.28.0 (for the optional QMI support)

 * The 1.16.x branch will be the last one supporting the 'LEGACY' and 'PARANOID'
   filter modes; standard distributions are advised to use the default 'STRICT'
   mode if they aren't using it already (i.e. running the daemon without any
   explicit '--filter-policy' option).

 * A new 'qcom-soc' plugin is implemented to be able to use ModemManager in
   Qualcomm SoCs like the MSM8916 or MSM8974. This plugin uses a combination of
   RPMSG based control ports plus BAM-DMUX based network ports. This plugin is
   disabled by default, even when `--enable-all-plugins` is used, and if wanted
   it must be explicitly enabled with `--enable-plugin-qcom-soc`. Systems
   targeting this kind of SoCs, like postmarketos, should enable it. Standard
   distributions may or may not include it, up to the targeted hardware in each
   distribution.

 * Gentoo's 'libelogind' library may now be used to detect the systemd
   suspend/resume support.

The API is backwards compatible with the previous releases, the only updates
are the following:

 * Modem interface:
   ** Updated the 'Ports' property so that it exposes all ports that are
      owned by the modem even if they are explicitly ignored and not used.
   ** New 'SimSlots' property that exposes the available SIM slots in the modem,
      including the SIM object paths in each of them if the cards are present.
   ** New 'PrimarySimSlot' property indicating which of the slots in the
      'SimSlots' array is the one currently active.
   ** New 'SetPrimarySimSlot' method to select which SIM slot in the 'SimSlots'
      array should be considered active. When the switch happens, the modem will
      be fully re-probed.

 * Signal interface:
   ** New 'Nr5g' dictionary property including signal information for the 5GNR
      access technology.

 * SIM interface:
   ** New 'Active' boolean property, indicating whether the SIM object is the
      currently active one.
   ** New 'Eid' string property, indicating the EID of the card, if any.

 * New udev tags:
   ** New 'ID_MM_PORT_TYPE_QMI' tag to explicitly flag a port as being QMI, when
      there is no other way to guess the type of port; e.g. this tag is not
      needed for ports exposed by the qmi_wwan driver.
   ** New 'ID_MM_PORT_TYPE_MBIM' tag to explicitly flag a port as being MBIM,
      when there is no other way to guess the type of port; e.g. this tag is not
      needed for ports exposed by the cdc_mbim driver.

The most important features and changes in this release are the following:

 * Implemented support for Multi SIM Single Standby support, for systems that
   have multiple SIM slots and they can select which of them (only one) is
   active at any given time. Currently implemented for QMI modems only.

 * If the modem enabling phase fails in a fatal way, an implicit disabling
   sequence is now run, in order to avoid leaving the modem in an inconsistent
   state.

 * If the connection attempt includes user/password information but no explicit
   authentication type, CHAP will now be used by default instead of PAP.

 * Full USB device removal events reported via udev are no longer used. The
   device removal logic relies exclusively on independent port removal events,
   as that logic is supported for all subsystems and kernel device backends
   (e.g. also working for non-USB devices and for systems without udev like
   OpenWRT).

 * Added support to monitor the 'rpmsg' subsystem, but only in plugins that
   explicitly require its use (e.g. the 'qcom-soc' plugin).

 * New options in the ModemManager daemon:
   ** Added new '--test-no-suspend-resume' option to disable the runtime
      suspend/resume support even if the daemon was built with it.
   ** Added new '--test-no-udev' option to disable the runtime udev support even
      if the daemon was built with it.

 * Serial:
   ** Also match OK or ERROR responses that are not at end of line.

 * SIM:
   ** Force reprobing the modem if a new SIM is detected in a modem that
      initially started in Failed state without SIM.
   ** Force reprobing the modem if the lock status cannot be read after sending
      SIM-PUK, so that it transitions to the Failed state.
   ** Force reprobing the modem if a PUK lock is discovered after sending
      SIM-PIN, so that it transitions to the Failed state.

 * QMI:
   ** The logic no longer depends on the service version reported by each
      client, the support for each feature is explicitly probed instead.
   ** Implemented SIM profile (eUICC) change detection.
   ** Support for QMI modems on kernels < 3.6 is dropped. Only kernels where the
      QMI control ports are exposed in the 'usbmisc' subsystem are supported.
   ** Implemented additional step in the connection logic to allow binding the
      WDS client to a given SIO port, required in the BAM-DMUX driver setup.
   ** Implemented support for the initial EPS bearer settings logic.
   ** Disabled explicit signal and access technology polling if indications have
      been correctly enabled.

 * MBIM:
   ** Enable SIM hot swap detection logic with QMI over MBIM.
   ** Allow plugins to specify explicitly that QMI over MBIM is not supported.

 * libmm-glib:
   ** Added missing APIs to get/set RM protocol in the Simple connect settings.

 * Plugins:
   ** gosuncn: new plugin, for now just with port type hints for the GM800.
   ** quectel: implemented GPS support with +QGPS.
   ** quectel: implemented custom time support check to prefer +CTZU=3 instead
      of +CTZU=1 so that the modem reports localtime instead of UTC in +CCLK.
   ** sierra: added support for XMM-specific features (e.g. EM7345).
   ** cinterion: implemented support for the initial EPS bearer settings logic.
   ** cinterion: added SIM hot swap support to AT-based modems.
   ** huawei: updated to avoid applying multiple port type hint methods.
   ** huawei: updated the ^GETPORTMODE logic so that we don't assume the hints
      in the response apply to specific USB interfaces.

The following features which were backported to 1.14.x releases are also present
in ModemManager 1.16.0:

 * location: allow CID only updates.
 * sms: allow sending/receiving UTF-16 as if it were UCS-2.
 * modem: don't consider charset setup failure as fatal.
 * QMI: fix reporting signal strength indications.
 * QMI: fix parsing of USSD indications with UTF-16 data.
 * QMI: run network registration with NAS Set System Selection Preference.
 * QMI: when connection aborted, ensure network handles are released.
 * MBIM: don't fail IPv4v6 connection attempt if only IPv4 succeeds.
 * cinterion: improve user/password handling in AT^SGAUTH calls.
 * cinterion: removed limitation to IPv4 only PDP contexts.
 * cinterion: configure the PLAS9 to send URCs correctly.
 * quectel: add support for MBIM devices.
 * telit: add initial delay for AT ports to become responsive.
 * udev: updated all AT/QCDM/GPS port type hints in all plugins to bind them to
   TTY ports only.


ModemManager 1.14.0
-------------------------------------------
This is a new stable release of ModemManager.

The following notes are directed to package maintainers:

 * This version requires:
   ** GLib/GObject/GIO >= 2.48.0
   ** libmbim >= 1.24.0 (for the optional MBIM support)
   ** libqmi >= 1.26.0 (for the optional QMI support)

 * Build updated with several improvements:
   ** The build has been updated to use by default all warnings enabled by
      AX_COMPILER_FLAGS(), and therefore when building the release from a git
      checkout, autoconf-archive >= 2017.03.21 is now required. This new build
      dependency isn't required when building from the release tarball.
   ** Also when building from a git checkout, beware because by default
      --enable-compile-warnings=error is enabled, which implies -Werror. If
      you'd like to build from git and avoid -Werror, you should explicitly use
      --enable-compile-warnings=yes (to keep the warnings but without being
      errors), --enable-compile-warnings=no (to disable all the extra warnings
      enabled by default) or --disable-Werror (to unconditionally make all
      compiler warnings non-fatal).
   ** Users can now preselect which plugins to build and install during
      configure, with the --enable-plugin-[PLUGIN-NAME] options. The user can
      also build and install all except for some, just by using the
      --enable-all-plugins option followed by --disable-plugin-[PLUGIN-NAME].
      By default all plugins are enabled, so all of them built and installed.
      This new set of options are useful for users building custom systems
      where they already know what kind of devices they're going to have, it
      isn't recommended for standard distributions.

The only updates in the public API are the following:

 * Modem interface:
   ** Added support for AT-based and/or QMI-based 5G devices, which will report
      the new MM_MODEM_CAPABILITY_5GNR capability.
   ** Deprecated the MM_MODEM_CAPABILITY_LTE_ADVANCED capability, as it was
      never used in any implementation.

 * Bearer interface:
   ** Added additional 'attempts', 'failed-attempts', 'total-rx-bytes',
      'total-tx-bytes' and 'total-duration' values in the 'Stats' property
      exposed by the Bearer objects.

The most important features and changes in this release are the following:

 * The daemon switched to 'STRICT' filter mode by default. The old 'DEFAULT'
   mode is renamed to 'LEGACY' and is considered now deprecated. Under the
   'STRICT' filter mode, the TTY blacklist and greylist are ignored, and the
   port probing mechanism uses its own heuristics to guess whether a given TTY
   is owned by a modem or not.

 * Added a new implicit whitelist rules applicable in 'STRICT' filter mode, so
   that all devices with a USB vid matching one of the vids allowed by the
   different installed plugins are implicitly allowed.

 * Updated daemon logging so that we always prefix the messages with a string
   identifying which modem the log refers to, making it easy to grep logs for
   one specific device if the system has more than one.

 * Updated the probing logic to make sure we don't attempt a re-probe when the
   device is gone.

 * Probing logic now allows new ports detected up to 1500ms since last port
   added, useful on OpenWrt setups where ports are notified one by one via
   hotplug events.

 * AT:
   ** Moved the charset definition logic to the initialization phase instead of
      the enabling phase, because the feature support checks may already require
      string processing based on the current charset.
   ** Updated manual registration operation to attempt using current charset
      (e.g. UCS2) if ASCII fails.

 * QMI:
   ** Devices using the LOC service for GNSS will now also setup the list of
      required NMEA traces before starting the engine.
   ** Implemented 3GPP USSD support using the Voice service.
   ** Update carrier code if registration changes from one roaming operator to
      another.
   ** Explicitly disable autoconnect during modem enabling phase, because it
      interferes with our connection management logic.
   ** Fallback to raw-ip if WDA Get Data Format requests arguments, as in most
      new 5G devices.
   ** Updated to always use the asynchronous close() operation.
   ** Handle disconnection indications during connection attempts.

 * MBIM:
   ** Update carrier code if registration changes from one roaming operator to
      another.
   ** Implement reset in Intel-based and Qualcomm-based devices.
   ** Avoid LTE attach config/status if unsupported.
   ** Updated to make sure all allocated QMI CIDs are released during shutdown.

 * SIM interface:
   ** Don't allow sending PIN/PUK if not required.

 * 3GPP interface:
   ** Fixed manual re-registration to the same operator.

 * CDMA interface:
   ** Don't allow multiple concurrent activation attempts.
   ** Disallow empty carrier code in automatic activation.

 * Bearer interface:
   ** Updated to avoid connection checks or stats updates while disconnecting.

 * libmm-glib:
   ** New 'mm_location_gps_nmea_get_traces()' method to retrieve a NULL
      terminated array of strings with all cached NMEA traces.
   ** Deprecated the 'mm_location_gps_nmea_build_full()' method.

 * mmcli:
   ** Added a new 'any' lookup keyword for the --modem and --sim options, useful
      when the system is only expected to have one single device.

 * Plugins:
   ** broadmobi: new plugin, right now just with port type hints for the BM818.
   ** foxconn: new plugin to support the T77W968 (both with and without eSIM).
   ** dell,dw5821e: added support for the DW5821e with eSIM variant.
   ** huawei: don't delay reporting network initiated disconnects.
   ** huawei: try to read port type hints from interface descriptions.
   ** huawei: avoid using the QCDM port during a voice call.
   ** cinterion: skip sim ready check for modules that don't support it.
   ** cinterion: implemented radio/band handling for LTE modems.
   ** cinterion: added Signal interface support bsaed on AT^SMONI.
   ** cinterion: added support for MBIM based devices like the PLS62-W.
   ** quectel: updated to detect SIM hot swap via +QUSIM URCs.
   ** fibocom: added support for QMI based devices like the FM150.
   ** ublox: ignore error when disconnecting last LTE bearer.
   ** ublox: implement support to enable and detect +UUDTMF URCs.
   ** ublox: added blacklist rules for GPS modules in the plugin itself.
   ** sierra: implement manual and automatic CDMA activation.
   ** novatel: implement manual and automatic CDMA activation.

All the features and fixes which were backported to 1.12.x releases are also
present in ModemManager 1.14.0.


ModemManager 1.12.0
-------------------------------------------
This is a new stable release of ModemManager.

The following notes are directed to package maintainers:

 * This version requires:
   ** libmbim >= 1.18.0 (for the optional MBIM support)
   ** libqmi >= 1.24.0 (for the optional QMI support)

 * The build allows to configure with '--with-at-command-via-dbus' in order to
   unconditionally enable the Modem.Command() method to allow running AT
   commands through ModemManager. This is not suggested for standard
   distributions, though.

The most important features and changes in this release are the following:

 * Modem interface:
   ** Updated logic to avoid assuming that setting bands or modes is immediate,
      the daemon will now actively monitor for those updates to happen before
      returning success.

 * 3GPP interface:
   ** libmm-glib: deprecated the mm_pco_list_free() helper method.

 * Simple interface:
   ** api,libmm-glib: deprecated the 'subscription state' property.

 * Location interface:
   ** Fixed 'unknown' lat/long/alt numeric values.
   ** Added support for MSB A-GPS in addition to MSA A-GPS.

 * Voice interface:
   ** Improved voice call management with call id detection and tracking.
   ** Improved detailed call state transitions on generic modems that support
      call list polling.
   ** Added support for GSM supplementary services, including call waiting,
      call transfer, call deflection, multiparty calls...
   ** Added emergency call support, allowing voice call to emergency numbers
      even without SIM or with SIM-PIN locked.
   ** Deprecated all properties except for 'number' in the CreateCall()
      method.

 * Messaging interface:
   ** Updated to report SMS timestamps in correct ISO8601 format.

 * Bearer:
   ** Improved unused CID lookup to allow selecting non-sequential CIDs.
   ** Disabled all AT protocol based context monitoring when PPP is used for
      the connection, in order to properly sync with pppd, which should be the
      one detecting the disconnections (already in 1.10.6).

 * QMI:
   ** Improved support to list stored firmware images in Sierra devices.
   ** Added additional lock check retries on 'SIM not inserted' errors.
   ** Updated explicit registration attempt to report success only when the
      target requested network is registered.
   ** Added MSB A-GPS support.
   ** Implemented automatic carrier configuration selection using PDC service
      (already in 1.10.2).

 * mmcli:
   ** New machine-readable JSON output with '--output-json'.
   ** Updated to allow using the modem UID to specify SIM operations.

 * udev:
   ** New ID_MM_PORT_TYPE_AUDIO generic udev tag to identify ports that
      should be used for in-band audio.
   ** Removed support for the ID_MM_PLATFORM_DRIVER_PROBE udev tag, as it
      is no longer required given that the more generic explicit whitelist
      may be used to flag which devices should be probed.
   ** Renamed ID_MM_DEVICE_MANUAL_SCAN_ONLY to ID_MM_TTY_MANUAL_SCAN_ONLY,
      given that the tag only applies to TTYs.
   ** ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE is no longer used internally in ModemManager, and
      is instead targeted to users that want to explicitly ignore specific
      devices regardless of what filter type is in use (already in 1.10.6).

 * dbus:
   ** Updated to always report the registered MM_CORE_ERROR_CANCELLED error
      instead of the implicit G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED ones generated by GLib.

 * GObject introspection:
   ** Fixed setup to explicitly skip all non-API methods.

 * Plugins:
   ** tplink: new plugin.
   ** dlink: new plugin.
   ** xmm: added MSB A-GPS support.
   ** dell,dw5821e: update to allow unmanaged GPS support on the TTY even
      when raw/NMEA GPS is enabled via QMI/LOC.
   ** quectel: updated to allow TTY-only devices.
   ** telit: added GPS support.
   ** telit: improved band management with #BND.
   ** simtech: added improved voice call support.
   ** simtech: added support for LTE devices.
   ** simtech: improved signal quality reporting logic.
   ** simtech: added GPS support for the SIM7000/SIM7600 family.
   ** cinterion: added support for time updates.
   ** cinterion: added improved voice call support.
   ** ublox: added improved voice call support.
   ** ublox: improved band management with UBANDSEL.

All the features and fixes which were backported to 1.10.x releases are also
present in ModemManager 1.12.0.


ModemManager 1.10.0
-------------------------------------------
This is a new stable release of ModemManager.

The following notes are directed to package maintainers:

 * This version requires:
   ** libmbim >= 1.18.0 (for the optional MBIM support)
   ** libqmi >= 1.22.0 (for the optional QMI support)

The most important features and changes in this release are the following:

 * udev:
   ** Consolidated common tag names among all the supported plugins. E.g.
      ID_MM_PORT_TYPE_GPS, ID_MM_PORT_TYPE_AT_*, ID_MM_PORT_TYPE_QCDM...
      All these generic tags are included as symbols in the API, and
      compatibility will be maintained for these. Custom setups of
      ModemManager relying on previously available per-plugin udev tags may
      need to manually port them to this new generic subset.
   ** New tag to allow specifying flow control settings to use in serial ports.

 * Core:
   ** Avoid probing other protocols on TTYs tagged in udev with specific port
      type tags (e.g. avoid probing QCDM if a port is tagged as AT). This allows
      faster port probing and modem detection for known modem layouts.
   ** Implemented support to enable and handle +CGEV URCs for asynchronous
      connection state updates in AT-controlled devices.

 * Manager interface:
   ** New runtime daemon version reporting.
   ** New support for requesting device inhibition, e.g. so that ModemManager
      stops completely using a modem device until the inhibition is released.
      This feature is implemented to allow fwupd taking over of a device
      completely for as long as it needs during a firmware update.

 * Modem interface:
   ** All methods are always connected, even in Failed state.
   ** Allow parallel Enable()/Disable() calls.
   ** Deprecated redundant ListBearers() method, the read-only Bearers property
      is already showing the same information.

 * Bearer interface:
   ** New 'BearerType' property, e.g. to specify whether a bearer is the initial
      LTE default bearer or not.
   ** Deprecated 'number' field in bearer settings. Applications do not need to
      send the 'number' field in Bearer.Connect() or in Modem.Simple.Connect(),
      as the setting is totally ignored.

 * mmcli:
   ** New 'key-value' output, easier to parse by scripts than the default.
   ** Removed redundant '--location-get-XXX' actions, as the '--location-get'
      already reports the location information for all sources.
   ** Removed redundant '--simple-status' action, as the same information can be
      obtained through different mmcli operations.
   ** New manager '--inhibit-device' action and modem-specific '--inhibit', to
      allow requesting device inhibition.

 * 3GPP interface:
   ** New support for exposing the network reported Protocol Configuration
      Options (PCO), to be used instead of the new deprecated Subscription
      State property.
   ** New support for exposing the initial LTE default bearer status.
   ** New support for configuring the initial LTE default bearer settings.

 * Location interface:
   ** New LTE Tracking Area Code (TAC) in 3GPP location information.
   ** New support for injecting assistance data (e.g. Qualcomm XTRA) into the
      GNSS engine, useful when there is no mobile connection to use MSA A-GPS.

 * Firmware interface:
   ** Support for reporting firmware update support properties, e.g. specifying
      which update methods are supported. This information will be consumed by
      fwupd in order to allow upgrading firmware in devices managed by
      ModemManager.

 * Voice interface:
   ** Multiple improvements and fixes in the voice call management logic
      implemented with generic AT commands.
   ** Added AudioPort and AudioFormat properties to the Call object.
   ** Added new generic audio channel setup/cleanup handlers in the Call object.

 * QMI:
   ** New LOC service based GNSS support, including A-GPS setup via SUPL server.
   ** New support for the "extended" LTE band list.
   ** New support for reading IMSI and ICCID with the UIM service.

 * MBIM:
   ** Implemented support for processing Protocol Configuration Options using
      Microsoft-defined Basic Connect Extensions.
   ** Implemented support for LTE attach status and configuration using
      Microsoft-defined Basic Connect Extensions.
   ** Implemented support for the extended signal interface and for 3GPP location
      details using the AT&T specific service.
   ** Implemented support for 3GPP USSD operations using the standard USSD
      service.
   ** For Qualcomm-based MBIM devices, those with QMI-over-MBIM support, a whole
      new set of features is now available, including: QMI LOC/PDS location
      support, allowed/preferred mode management, frequency band selection,
      power management operations...

 * Plugins:
   ** xmm: new XMM plugin, with shared logic (allowed/preferred mode management,
      frequency band selection, power management operations, extended signal
      quality reporting, GPS/A-GPS...) for Intel XMM based devices.
   ** fibocom: new plugin, with support for generic MBIM and XMM-based devices.
   ** dell: added support for XMM-based devices, like the DW5820e.
   ** dell: added custom support for the DW5821e, including 'unmanaged' GPS and
      firmware update integration details.
   ** cinterion: new shared interface to include all logic shared between Option
      and Option/HSO devices.
   ** sierra-legacy: implemented connection monitoring support.
   ** u-blox: added support for extended call state transitions.
   ** u-blox: added CDC-ECM support for SARA/LISA-U2xx modems.
   ** altair-lte: migrated from SubscriptionState to PCO.

All the features and fixes which were backported to 1.8.x releases are also present
in ModemManager 1.10.0.


ModemManager 1.8.0
-------------------------------------------
This is a new stable release of ModemManager.

The following notes are directed to package maintainers:

 * This version requires:
   ** GLib 2.36.0
   ** gettext 0.19.8 (for the optional rebuild of documentation)
   ** libmbim >= 1.16.0 (for the optional MBIM support)
   ** libqmi >= 1.20.0 (for the optional QMI support)
   ** libsystemd >= 209 or libsystemd-login >= 183 (for the optional suspend
      and resume support)
   ** libsystemd >= 209 (for the optional systemd journal support)
   ** polkit >= 0.97 (for the optional PolicyKit support)

 * This version no longer requires:
   ** intltool (replaced by new features in gettext)

 * Distributions using systemd should explicitly use the following configure
   options:
   ** '--with-systemd-suspend-resume': the only supported source for suspend and
   resume events is now systemd, so the previous '--with-suspend-resume=[]'
   option was renamed.
   ** '--with-systemd-journal' to use the new journal support.

 * Distributions wanting to avoid ModemManager poking TTY ports that isn't
   supposed to touch may start using the new 'STRICT' filter policy, given
   as an option to the ModemManager daemon (e.g. patching the default systemd
   service file provided). See below for more info about the filter policy and
   the side effects of using the STRICT approach:
   ** E.g. ModemManager --filter-policy=STRICT

The most important features and changes in this release are the following:

 * New 'filter policy' setting in the ModemManager daemon to decide which ports
   are probed and how. Currently these levels are defined:
   ** WHITELIST-ONLY: Only devices or ports explicitly whitelisted with the new
      'ID_MM_DEVICE_PROCESS' udev tag are probed.
   ** DEFAULT: All ports are allowed to be probed except for the ones explicitly
      greylisted as RS232 adapters or completely blacklisted. This is the
      default approach that was used until now, and the default as well in this
      release if a different one isn't requested.
   ** STRICT: The daemon defines a set of heuristics to try to detect modems and
      ports to probe. Only the TTY ports that are very very likely to be modem
      ports are probed, therefore completely avoiding the need of having a
      separate blacklist or RS232 adapter greylist. But note that this policy
      may end up ignoring some devices, like TTY controlled modems without an
      associated network port.
   ** PARANOID: This is equivalent to running the STRICT mode but also applying
      the blacklist and RS232 greylist filters explicitly.

 * Device 'naming'. This release includes logic to allow 'naming' devices with
   the ID_MM_PHYSDEV_UID udev tag, so that the names can then be used in e.g.
   mmcli and also exposed in the 'Device' property in the Modem interface. This
   new setup makes it possible to give the devices unique names that are kept
   across reboots.

 * Allow skipping the automatic scan for devices in the daemon with the new
   '--no-auto-scan' daemon option. Instead, the daemon may be called with the
   '--initial-kernel-events=[PATH]' option including a predefined list of ports
   or otherwise get the port additions reported during runtime with the
   mmcli --report-kernel-event=[] command.

 * Allow building and running without 'udev'. In this setup, the previously
   explained '--no-auto-scan' is enabled by default, so ports are not
   automatically detected .Note that this setup is not suggested for standard
   distributions: if udev is available in the system, it is the preferred method
   to manage the port addition and removal.

 * SIM hot swap. The core includes the needed logic to support SIM hot swap in
   the different devices, although for now it's only tested for Telit and MBIM
   modems. If a SIM hot swap is detected, the modem is flagged as failed and
   reprobed from scratch.

 * Connection status monitoring logic. In order to try to detect network
   initiated disconnections, a generic setup is provided to plugins so that they
   can implement explicit connection status checks that would be executed
   periodically.

 * New support for 3GPP CSFB states and operation modes. We now support
   registration states reported as "SMS only" or "CSFB not preferred", and
   provide APIs to set and get the "UE mode of operation for EPS".

This version comes with the following new features:

 * Build and system:
   ** Updated the systemd service file with additional security related rules.
   ** Added support for systemd journal logging.
   ** Updated most of the code to use GTask instead of the deprecated
      GSimpleAsyncResult based operations.
   ** ChangeLog is built from git during the dist tarball generation.

 * New translations: Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Slovak, Hungarian, Czech,
   Ukrainian, Swedish and Indonesian.

 * API:
   ** Defined additional GSM, UMTS and LTE frequency bands.
   ** The MMModemBand enumeration values (EUTRAN, UTRAN and CDMA) have been
      renamed to consolidate how they are defined. A compatibility layer has
      been provided to avoid breaking the API.
   ** New 'HardwareRevision' property in the Modem interface.
   ** New 'EpsUeModeOperation' property and 'SetEpsUeModeOperation' method in
      the Modem 3GPP interface.

 * Core:
   ** Updated libqcdm to load signal strength from QCDM EVDO Pilot Sets.
   ** Updated udev rules with new per-vendor rules for quicker processing.
   ** Explicitly ignored ports are never probed now, but they will be reported
      as owned by the device and exposed in the Ports property.
   ** New 'ID_MM_TTY_BAUDRATE' udev tag to specify the baudrate to use in RS232
      TTY ports.
   ** If using UCS2, still assume that the operator name may be given in ASCII.
   ** Explicitly open QCDM ports anytime it's needed, instead of assuming they
      are open when enabled.
   ** Query supported ME event reporting options and automatically set the best
      choice based on the supported ones.
   ** Query supported flow control modems and automatically set the best choice
      based on the supported ones.
   ** Explicitly configure flow control settings on the TTY as soon as it is
      connected, only applicable for RS232 devices.
   ** Implemented generic unlock retries loading.

 * MBIM:
   ** Explicitly reprobe the modem when the mbim-proxy is detected dead.
   ** Workaround implemented to keep track of the PIN1 unlock retries as the
      protocol isn't very good allowing this.
   ** Load and expose HW revision.

 * QMI:
   ** Explicitly reprobe the modem when the qmi-proxy is detected dead.
   ** Load and expose HW revision.
   ** Detect port closed and forbid client allocation operations.
   ** New optional connection status monitoring support, enabled by default for
      the Netgear AC341U.

 * Location interface:
   ** Disabled by default for MBIM modems.

 * Messaging interface:
   ** Try decoding with UTF-16BE when UCS-2 reported.

 * Plugins:
   ** u-blox: new plugin, currently supporting the TOBY-L2, TOBY-L4, TOBY-R2,
      LARA-R2 and LISA-R2.
   ** quectel: new plugin, supporting generic AT/QMI based modems.
   ** cinterion: implemented support for devices exposing a WWAN network
      interface.
   ** cinterion: support changing modes in LTE capable devices.
   ** cinterion: added GPS support for devices controlled only with AT^SGPSC.
   ** cinterion: use ^SIND unsolicited messages for access tech reporting.
   ** huawei: implemented Signal interface.
   ** telit: added support for RS232, QMI and MBIM modems.
   ** novatel: cleaned up registration state and access tech reporting.
   ** novatel-lte: implemented unlock retries loading.
   ** dell: speed probing time up and reduce udev dependency.
   ** mbm: added GPS support for the Dell DW5560.

The following features which were backported to 1.6.x releases are also present
in ModemManager 1.8.0:

 * Build and System:
   ** Explicitly use -DGLIB_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED=GLIB_VERSION_2_36 and
      -DGLIB_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED=GLIB_VERSION_2_36 so that we don't get warnings
      for GLib features that are flagged as deprecated in newer versions.
   ** Dropped After=syslog.target rule in systemd service file.
   ** Added all ModemManager udev tags also in "bind" events.

 * Core:
   ** Improved detection of 4G-only modems.
   ** TTY is set as connected as soon as ATD replies.
   ** Removed the default ID_MM_PLATFORM_DRIVER_PROBE whitelist.

 * Signal interface:
   ** Report RSCP if available.
   ** New generic implementation of the Signal interface in AT-based devices
      using AT+CESQ.

 * QMI:
   ** Run FCC auth sequence if "InvalidTransition" is reported when going
      online.
   ** Added WDS reporting event support.

 * Plugins:
   ** huawei: let the E3372 run NDISDUP via TTY (when the exposed cdc-wdm is
      non-functional).
   ** telit: added support for the GE910.

ModemManager 1.6.0
-------------------------------------------
This is a new stable release of ModemManager.

 * This version requires:
   ** GLib 2.36.0
   ** gettext 0.19.3
   ** libmbim >= 1.14.0 (for the optional MBIM support)
   ** libqmi >= 1.16.0 (for the optional QMI support)
   ** libsystemd >= 209 or libsystemd-login >= 183 (for the optional suspend
      and resume support)

 * For distributions using systemd, it is suggested that the new optional
   suspend/resume is explicitly requested during configure with the new
   '--with-suspend-resume=systemd' argument.

This version comes with the following new features:

 * Core:
   ** Implemented support for suspend/resume detection, currently working
      when systemd is in use. Whenever the system is suspended, we'll flag the
      modems as invalid so that they are re-probed from scratch when the system
      is resumed.
   ** Added cancellation support for the probing operations.
   ** Reworked and simplified the serial port response processing.

 * Location interface:
   ** Added A-GPS support, currently available only for QMI based modems with
      PDS service.
   ** Added support for updating the default GPS refresh time.

 * Time interface:
   ** New default implementation for all AT-based modems.

 * Voice interface:
   ** New DBus interface to allow the management of voice calls, which currently
      assumes that the audio channel is setup out of ModemManager.

 * Bearer:
   ** New support for reporting statistics of the ongoing connection with a new
      'Stats' property, currently available for QMI and MBIM based modems.

 * QMI:
   ** Implemented support for devices which only work in "raw IP" mode, like
      the Sierra MC7455.
   ** Implemented support for SIM related operations using the UIM service, as
      newer modems with multi-SIM capabilities don't suppor the legacy DMS UIM
      operations.
   ** Implemented support for detecting network-initiated disconnections.

 * MBIM:
   ** If online mode fails, try to use the 'DMS Set FCC Authentication' QMI
      message via the QMI-over-MBIM support, if supported by the device.

 * udev:
   ** Added new supported 'ID_MM_PORT_IGNORE' tag to allow fully ignoring ports
      specified by the user.

 * mmcli:
   ** Added command completion.
   ** Added new operations to use the Voice interface.
   ** Added new operations to manage the A-GPS settings.

 * Build:
   ** Added code coverage support.

 * Plugins:
   ** haier: new plugin to support the Haier CE81B.
   ** thuraya: new plugin for Thuraya satellite modems.
   ** sierra-legacy,sierra: the implementation for Sierra modems is now split
      into two different plugins: a 'legacy' one for the old PPP and DirectIP
      based modems and the standard one for the newer QMI and MBIM based ones.
   ** dell: new plugin for Dell rebranded devices from Novatel, Sierra or
      Ericsson.
   ** gobi: removed the plugin. All non-vendor specific QMI devices should now
      be managed by the generic plugin.
   ** mbm: dynamically load the list of supported modes.
   ** mbm: fixed several connection/disconnection issues.
   ** simtech: support QMI devices.
   ** huawei: implemented Voice call management support.
   ** huawei: use static IP addressing in NDISDUP capable devices if the AT^DHCP
      response provides the IP details.

The following features which were backported to 1.4.x releases are also present
in ModemManager 1.6.0:

 * MBIM:
   ** The mbim-proxy is used by default.
   ** Implemented support for disconnection status notification while connected.
   ** Disabled CDMA capabilities, until properly supported.

 * QMI:
   ** The qmi-proxy is used by default.
   ** If online mode fails, use 'DMS Set FCC Authentication', required by some
      rebranded Sierra modems (e.g. Dell branded ones).
   ** Implemented support for loading SIM operator id and name.
   ** Implemented power-cycle reset functionality.

 * Plugins:
   ** telit: added support for new devices, like HE910, UE910 and UL865.
   ** telit: implemented dynamic port identification.
   ** telit: implemented unlock retries loading.
   ** telit: implemented supported/current bands management.

ModemManager 1.4.0
-------------------------------------------
This is a new stable release of ModemManager.

 * This version requires libmbim >= 1.10.0.

This version comes with the following updates in the interfaces:

 * Updated the logic around the IP configuration properties in the Bearer:
   ** Setting DHCP as IP method in the IPv6 settings means that SLAAC should
      be used to retrieve correct addressing and routing details.
   ** DHCP IP method may now be combined with an explicit static IP address, as
      IPv6 SLAAC may require the link-local address to be present.
   ** MTU is now also included in the IP configuration properties, if specified
      by the modem, and applicable to both DHCP and STATIC methods.
 * New 'OFF' power state, which fully switches off the modem device. After
   setting the modem in this state, no further use of it can be done. Currently
   available in Wavecom and Cinterion.
 * Location interface: new 'unmanaged GPS' support, which allows to start/stop
   the GPS module in the modem, while leaving the location information retrieval
   to other processes. Currently available in modems with independent GPS TTYs,
   like Option/HSO, Cinterion and Huawei.
 * New Test DBus interface: not to be installed, just for internal system tests.

Other notable changes include:
 * MBIM: support for ZTE and Sequans Communications modems.
 * Ericsson MBM: Support for AT-capable /dev/cdc-wdm ports.
 * Huawei: improved support for Network time retrieval.
 * Huawei: implemented GPS support.
 * Huawei: support for /dev/cdc-wdm AT ports via the new huawei-cdc-ncm driver.
 * Cinterion: implemented GPS support.
 * Cinterion: implemented unlock retries loading.
 * Cinterion: gather port types for multi-tty devices.
 * Cinterion: custom wait for SIM readiness after SIM-PIN unlock.
 * Wavecom: custom wait for SIM readiness after SIM-PIN unlock.
 * Probing: new flag to identify hotplugged devices which don't need full reset.
 * Tests: internal refactor of the ports handling code, allowing test-driven
   virtual ports and system tests run during 'make check'. This new feature also
   comes with a new internal 'Test' DBus interface, as well as new --test-[*]
   options in the ModemManager program.
 * and many more fixes...
